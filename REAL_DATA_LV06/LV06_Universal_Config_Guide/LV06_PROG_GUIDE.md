# Lucky Miner LV06: Programmer's Guide to Neuromorphic Computing

## 1. Introduction
The Lucky Miner LV06, powered by Bitmain's **BM1387** or **BM1366** ASICs, is a powerful tool for Neuromorphic Reservoir Computing. While designed for SHA-256 mining, its hardware architecture can be repurposed as a high-entropy physical reservoir for chaotic time-series prediction and complex non-linear mapping.

## 2. System Architecture
The device consists of two main components:
*   **The Controller (ESP32):** Manages the web interface, WiFi/Ethernet, and the Stratum connection. It parses incoming jobs and schedules them for the ASIC.
*   **The ASIC (BM1387/1366):** The computational core. It performs quadrillions of hash operations. Any variation in its timing or nonce selection (Jitter) is the basis of our neuromorphic state.

## 3. The Reservoir Computing Workflow
To use the LV06 as a reservoir, we follow the **HRC (Holographic Reservoir Computing)** paradigm:

1.  **Input Injection:** We encode training data into the Bitcoin Block Header (Coinbase Transaction).
2.  **Stratum Notification:** We send this block to the miner via the `mining.notify` method.
3.  **State Harvesting:** The miner returns "Shares" (solutions found). The **arrival time** and **nonce value** of these shares represent the high-dimensional state of the reservoir.
4.  **Training:** We use a simple linear model (like Ridge Regression) to map the harvested states back to our target values.

## 4. Key Performance Drivers
### Frequency Modulation
Higher frequencies (e.g., 550 MHz) increase the entropy and non-linearity of the reservoir. However, excessive frequency without voltage compensation can lead to "Hardware Silence" or thermal shutdown.

### Difficulty Calibration
*   **Low Difficulty (< 1.0):** High share rate (25-50 Hz), useful for fast sampling but can saturate the ESP32 controller.
*   **High Difficulty (> 128):** Lower share rate but cleaner temporal resolution. Ideal for long-term memory tasks.

## 5. Best Practices
*   **Handshake Timing:** Always wait for the `mining.authorize` confirmation before injecting data.
*   **Cumulative Harvesting:** Instead of waiting for a specific time window, always process the entire buffer of received shares to avoid network jitter artifacts.
*   **Thermal Safety:** Monitor temperatures via the `/api/status` endpoint to prevent hardware degradation.
